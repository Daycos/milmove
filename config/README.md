# Configuration

## Container Definitions

The `*container-definition*` files define how the ECS containers are configured. They are primarily used to set non-secret environment variables.

## Database

The `database.yaml` file is for configuring how to connect to the database. In the app the database is configured using
environment variables. The environments "development", "test", and "container" each have specific modifications to the
database connection. Specifically, "test" environment will always use the database name `test_db` no matter what the
value of `$DB_NAME` is set to. The "container" environment will require that SSL mode is required.

Note: This file is critical for use with the `soda` command to initialize and migrate the DB.

## TLS cert/key (optional)

The `devlocal-https.*` files are a self-signed TLS cert/key pair. They are a [snake oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_oil_(cryptography)) certificate used to locally run the webserver during development. They are included as a convenience so engineers don't have to generate their own.
